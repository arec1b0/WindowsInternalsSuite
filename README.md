# Windows Internals Suite

A single native Windows application for inspecting operating-system internals:
processes, threads, virtual memory, PE files, kernel objects, tokens, heaps, and
the PEB/TEB. Conceptually similar to the Sysinternals utilities, but unified into
one modular, extensible tool.

> **Status: in development.** The `common` and `ntapi` layers are complete, and
> most of the `core` domain layer is implemented and building — the process,
> thread, memory, PE, module, handle, token, heap, PEB/TEB, system info, and
> symbol resolution providers all land through the `INativeApi` seam (symbols
> via `dbghelp`). The `ui` layer has started: the Win32-free viewmodel contracts
> and the first view model (`ProcessExplorerVM`) are in place, but the Win32
> view backend is not. The remaining `core` module (Native API monitor), the
> Win32 views, the app entry point, and the test suites are not started yet. See
> [Project status](#project-status) for the exact per-module state — the tree in
> [Architecture](#architecture) shows the *target* design, not what is shipped today.

## Goals

- **Native API first.** Where practical, the suite calls the Windows Native API
  (`ntdll` exports such as `NtQuerySystemInformation`, `NtOpenProcess`,
  `NtReadVirtualMemory`) instead of the higher-level Win32 wrappers.
- **No driver required.** The base feature set runs entirely in user mode.
  A kernel driver, if added later, stays optional.
- **Minimal third-party surface.** The core depends only on the Windows SDK
  (Win32, `ntdll`, `dbghelp`). Optional extras (Capstone disassembler,
  GoogleTest) are opt-in via CMake flags.
- **Correctness at ABI boundaries.** Native structures are defined locally and
  guarded with compile-time `static_assert` size checks to catch layout drift.

## Requirements

| Item        | Requirement                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| OS          | Windows 10 or 11, x64                                    |
| Compiler    | MSVC (Visual Studio 2022, toolset v143)                  |
| Language    | C++20                                                    |
| Build system| CMake ≥ 3.25                                            |
| Optional    | Ninja (for the command-line presets); clang-tidy        |

Some queries against protected or system processes require elevation
(`SeDebugPrivilege`). Without it, those operations degrade gracefully to
best-effort partial results rather than failing outright.

---

## Building

The project is CMake-based and ships with presets. Visual Studio 2022 opens the
folder directly (File → Open → Folder) and picks up `CMakePresets.json`.

### Visual Studio generator

```powershell
cmake --preset vs2022
cmake --build build\vs2022 --config Debug
```

### Ninja (command line)

The Ninja presets require the **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022**,
so the x64 toolchain is on `PATH`:

```powershell
cmake --preset ninja-debug
cmake --build build\ninja-debug
```

### Build options

| Option                   | Default | Effect                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `WIS_BUILD_TESTS`        | `ON`    | Build the unit-test target (fetches GoogleTest)|
| `WIS_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS` | `OFF`   | Treat compiler warnings as errors (`/WX`)     |
| `WIS_ENABLE_CLANG_TIDY`  | `OFF`   | Run clang-tidy during build (Ninja only)      |
| `WIS_ENABLE_CAPSTONE`    | `OFF`   | Enable the Capstone-based disassembler        |

> **Note:** `clang-tidy` integration works only with the Ninja/Makefile
> generators. The Visual Studio generator ignores `CMAKE_CXX_CLANG_TIDY`; a
> dedicated tidy target for VS builds is planned.

---

## Architecture

Layering is strict and one-directional: each layer depends only on the ones
below it. The UI never touches `ntdll` directly — it goes through the `core`
domain managers, which in turn go through the `INativeApi` seam. That seam is
what makes the domain layer unit-testable against a fake native backend.

```
app            composition root: wires the dependency graph, owns main()
 │
ui             Win32-free viewmodels + a swappable Win32 view backend
 │
core           domain logic: process/thread/memory/pe/handle/token/heap/pebteb/system/symbols/... managers & providers
 │
ntapi          typed wrappers over ntdll, behind the INativeApi interface
 │
common         cross-cutting primitives: Result<T,E>, RAII, logging, text
```

### Design principles

- **SOLID**, applied pragmatically. The most load-bearing part is DIP: `core`
  and `ui` depend on interfaces (`INativeApi`, `IProcessManager`, `ITokenInspector`, `IHeapInspector`, `IPebTebReader`, `ISystemInfoProvider`, `ISymbolResolver`, `IViewModel`, …), never on
  concrete implementations.
- **RAII everywhere** for OS resources — handles, `LocalAlloc` buffers,
  `VirtualAlloc` regions, and token privileges each have an owning wrapper.
- **`Result<T, E>` over exceptions** at module boundaries. This is a
  `std::expected`-compatible type for C++20; migrating to `std::expected` once
  the project moves to C++23 is a header swap. Exceptions remain reserved for
  genuinely exceptional conditions.
- **UTF-8 internally**, UTF-16 only at the Win32 boundary.

## Project status

The foundation and most of the `core` domain layer are implemented and building,
and the first slice of the `ui` layer (viewmodel contracts + `ProcessExplorerVM`)
is in place; the Native API monitor, the Win32 views, the app entry point, and
the tests are not started. This table tracks reality, not intent.

## Testing

The design keeps the testable layers isolated so they can be exercised without
live OS state: the `common` primitives (`Result`, RAII wrappers, hex formatting)
are self-contained, the `core` domain logic depends only on the `INativeApi`
seam, so it can run against a fake native backend instead of the real `ntdll`,
and the `ui` viewmodels are Win32-free with explicit test seams (e.g.
`ProcessExplorerVM::refreshAt` takes the sampling instant, so CPU deltas are
deterministic). The CMake test wiring is in place and guarded on `WIS_BUILD_TESTS`, but the
`tests/` tree and its suites have not been added yet. Once they land:

```powershell
ctest --preset vs2022-debug
```

---

## Roadmap

1. Finish the remaining `core` module: Native API monitor.
2. Add process/thread control (terminate, suspend, resume) behind explicit
   confirmation, kept separate from the read-only enumeration paths.
3. Thread stack walking on top of the existing `SymbolResolver`.
4. Stand up the `tests/` tree: `common` unit tests plus `core`/`ui` suites
   driven by a fake `INativeApi`.
5. Build out the UI: remaining viewmodels (threads, memory, modules, handles,
   …) alongside `ProcessExplorerVM`, then the Win32 view backend, with
   enumeration moved off the UI thread.
6. Optional extras: Capstone disassembly, report export (JSON/HTML), light/dark
   themes, plugins.
